            <h2>Maui</h2>
            <img src="images/maui.jpeg" alt="He is a mini doodle with brown/blond hair" width="400">

            <p>
                Maui is a two-year-old mini-doodle who thinks he is as big as a German shepherd. This mindset allows
                him to
                voice his opinion, especially when demanding food or attention. He is also a classic momma's boy, as
                he has
                learned if he is annoying enough, he can get anything he demands.
            </p>

            <p>
                During his lounging time, he gets to the highest chair he can get on and stares outside, waiting
                either for
                guests or belly rubs. He also has the tendency to force his mother to go to sleep as soon as his
                father goes to
                bed.
            </p>

                <h2>Cooky</h2>
                <img src="images/cookysmiley.jpg" alt="White and gray Bernedoodle sitting on a couch and smiling." width="400">
    
                <p>
                    Cooky is an 11 month old Bernedoodle. He likes to play, run around, go on walks, eat snacks and treats (not his own dog food), get pets and belly rubs, and cuddle. 
                    You can usually find him playing with his toys in the living room, chilling in the office room with my dad, or cooling off in the garage.
                </p>
    
                <p>
                    He's still a baby, but he can get super hyper. Whenever someone rings the doorbell, Cooky gets really excited, barking and dashing towards the front door. 
                    He also jumps really high when he's hyper and wags his tail like crazy. Overall, though, he likes to chill and cuddle just as much as he likes to play.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Jiji is a one year old gray tabby cat born in Miami, FL. She was adopted when she was a few weeks old. Her birthday is July 2nd 2022. Her favorite toy is her fish wand and her second favorite toy is a slinky.

                <p>

            <img src="images/hachi_onlawn.jpg" alt="Akita named Hachi sitting on the front lawn" width="400">

            <p>
                Hachi is a 13 year old Akita. He’s a very old boy who likes to play in snow and run laps around our yard. He is super nice and never bites. He is timid but friendly and will always come and greet visitors with a smile and a few barks.            
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Hachi is a jealous dog. Although shy, he does not like it when other dogs steal attention from him and he will lightly bite them. When Hachi shared the house with another dog, a small poodle, he would constantly bicker with the poodle when it was being loud. 
            </p>

        <p>
            Jazz spends most of his time lying on the couch. He doesn’t have the energy he used to have when he
            was younger.
            His favorite foods include cheese, steak, yogurt. He likes it when we mix steak juices with his
            kibble.

        <h2>Bacon Q Dog</h2>
        <img src="images/bacon.jpg" width = "400" alt="Brown labradoodle wearing colorful lei">

        <p>Bacon Q. Dog is a 9yr old labradoodle. He prefers to spend his days lounging among the three different beds/couches that his family has gifted him. He enjoys a walk or two around the neighborhood, as long as he can pretend that he doesn't see any of the other animals to avoid the embarrassment of not wanting to admit he has no wolf-like skills in chasing them.</p> 
        <P>At night just as the rest of the family is ready to relax, Bacon suddenly wants to release all of his energy. He will place his toys on a mini couch and frantically drag the couch around, giving his toys "a ride." There is also a lot of rolling. Lots and lots of rolling.</P>
